I made my first script at the age of 12 and never stopped. I've been a backend software developer since my last year at the Software Engineering degree. My main specialization is search. The biggest part of my profesional career I've been working in the development of search engines for e-commerces, building tools and systems to improve the relevancy of the search for stores all around the world.

Aside from my work, software is also a key part of my free time. I'm an avid member of the open-source world and I'm always trying to contribute in different projects, sometimes building my own libraries or content, but always under open-source licenses. Among my other hobbies, indie videogames and fantasy literature take a big chunk of my remaining time.
