		"description": "AllForOne is my end-of-degree project. It's an Android application to assist families with members diagnosed of the Alzheimer's disease providing tools like shared task management, geolocalization or real-time chat, all of this over a bonding system. It consisted in two big modules, the frontend was the Android app made in Kotlin and the backend was a Node.js API deployed in Azure. The communication between the points was made through HTTP with a REST API and via Websocket."

The project is divided in three main crates: the <strong>core</strong> managing all the backend logic, the <strong>desktop frontend</strong> using SDL2 and the <strong>web crate</strong> to compile the emulator to WebAssembly an be able to execute it on a webpage. The web version of the emulator can be used in one of the following links."
