# SotoEstevez.dev

This project holds the code of my portfolio web: [[https:://www.sotoestevez.dev](https://www.sotoestevez.dev)]([https:://www.sotoestevez.dev](https://www.sotoestevez.dev)).

Right now, the deployed page is unrelated to this repository as this is a new version to be deployed with all my new data and improved visuals.
