# sotoestevez.dev

Welcome to my portfolio. A simple page made in pure HTML5 and CSS3, but with a hidden funny side made in Rust and compiled to WASM so it can be run in the web.

Hope you like it and find some of the easter eggs (it's not difficult, the code is public lol).

> [!NOTE TO MYSELF]
> You still have to clear some things. Check with clippy pedantic possible improvements, try to move the Javascript code into a script, and add Advent of Code.
