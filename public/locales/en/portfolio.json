		"description": "AllForOne is my end-of-degree project. It's an Android application to assist families with members diagnosed of the Alzheimer's disease providing tools like shared task management, geolocalization or real-time chat, all of this over a bonding system. It consisted in two big modules, the frontend was the Android app made in Kotlin and the backend was a Node.js API deployed in Azure. The communication between the points was made through HTTP with a REST API and via Websocket."
