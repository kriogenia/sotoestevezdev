It's an Android application to assist families with members diagnosed of the <strong>Alzheimer's disease</strong> providing tools like shared task management, geolocalization or real-time chat, all of this over a bonding system. It consists in two big modules: the frontend, an <strong>Android app</strong> made in Kotlin; and the backend service, a <strong>Node.js API</strong> deployed in Azure. The communication between the points is made through HTTP with a REST API and via Websocket, depending on each use case."

The project is divided in three main crates: the <strong>core</strong> managing all the backend logic, the <strong>desktop frontend</strong> using SDL2 and the <strong>web crate</strong> to compile the emulator to WebAssembly an be able to execute it on a webpage. The web version of the emulator can be used in one of the following links."
